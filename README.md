At the Moment the script is doing a backup from the Mailcow Data, via mailcow-backup integrated scrupt, into a nextcloud folder via Nextcloud-User and Nextcloud-User-PW or via sFTP.

For more informations about the mailcow-backup script, please watch the following Link:

I will bring more Scripts when i finished the changeing.
